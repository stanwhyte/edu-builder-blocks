D-0003: SSM Parameter Store
===========================

This document outlines the strategy employed by this project for sharing variable data between stacks.  

A typical choice for meeting this requirement is to use CloudFormation Cross-Stack References.  These work well, but carry a drawback.  Namely, each parameter must be exported by a CloudFormation template.  

At first examination, this does not appear to be much of a drawback (and it typically is not).  However, occasionally it is valuable to use other solutions (scripts, manual configuration, etc.) to provide those variables to the template.  In addition, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain those Cross-Stack exports outside of the CloudFormation solution.

In order to allow the most deployment flexibility, while allowing multiple stacks to share data seamlessly, this project uses the [SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) for this cross-stack communication.

The naming convention is also designed to allow the most flexibility in deploying various workloads into AWS.  The format used is `/$Environment/$Workload/$Identifier/$AWSService/$AWSComponentId`.  For example, the public route table connected with the development environment would be `/DEV/Foundation/Public/EC2/RouteTable/Id`.

This allows multiple workloads and environments to be deployed in the same account and region as desired by the deployer.
